# Leaderstats-Touch-Event
A part if it's touched it will increase coins into the leaderstats.
So you put this into a part and rename it into "CoinPart" or you can just change the variables to whatever you want and put this script into the part.
Basically this script is a leaderstats that was added with IntValue which is a coin in this script, but there's an event if its touched it will increase the coins and if not it will stopped giving the player a coins.
